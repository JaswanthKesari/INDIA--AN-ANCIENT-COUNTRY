# **INDIA--AN-ANCIENT-COUNTRY**
### *Ancient India is the Indian subcontinent from prehistoric times to the start of Medieval India, which is typically dated (when the term is still used) to the end of the Gupta Empire. Ancient India was composed of the modern-day countries of Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, India, Nepal and Pakistan.*

## Periodisation of Indian history

An elaborate periodisation may be as follows:
* Indian pre-history Age (c.10,000â€“3300 BCE)
* Indian Civilizations on peak Indus Valley Civilisation (c. 3300-1750 BCE);
* Iron Age including Vedic period (c. 1750-600 BCE);
* "Second Urbanisation" (c. 600-200 BCE);
* Classical period (c. 200 BCE-1200 CE);[note 1]
* Pre-Classical period (c. 200 BCE-320 CE);
* "Golden Age" (Gupta Empire) (c. 320-650 CE);
* Late-Classical period (c. 650-1200 CE);
* Medieval period (c. 1200-1500 CE);
* Early Modern (c. 1500-1850);
* Modern period (British Raj and independence) (from c. 1850).

*India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of human civilization. It begins with a mysterious culture along the Indus River and in farming      communities in the southern lands of India.The History of India is punctuated by constant integration of migrating people with the diverse cultures that surround India.Available evidence suggests that the use of iron, copper and other metals was widely prevalent in the Indian sub-continent at a fairly early period, which is indicative of the progress that this part of the world had made. By the end of the fourth millennium BC, India had emerged as a region of highly developed civilization.*

## **The Indus Valley Civilization**

The History of India begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization, more precisely known as Harappan Civilization. It flourished around 2,500 BC, in the western part of South Asia, what today is Pakistan and Western India. The Indus Valley was home to the largest of the four ancient urban civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China. Nothing was known about this civilization till 1920s when the Archaeological Department of India carried out excavations in the Indus valley wherein the ruins of the two old cities, viz. Mohenjodaro and Harappa were unearthed. The ruins of buildings and other things like household articles, weapons of war, gold and silver ornaments, seals, toys, pottery wares, etc., show that some four to five thousand years ago a highly developed Civilization flourished in this region.

The Indus valley civilization was basically an urban civilization and the people lived in well-planned and well-built towns, which were also the centers for trade. The ruins of Mohenjodaro and Harappa show that these were magnificent merchant cities-well planned, scientifically laid, and well looked after. They had wide roads and a well-developed drainage system. The houses were made of baked bricks and had two or more storeys.

The highly civilized Harappans knew the art of growing cereals, and wheat and barley constituted their staple food. They consumed vegetables and fruits and ate mutton, pork and eggs as well. Evidences also show that they wore cotton as well as woollen garments. By 1500 BC, the Harappan culture came to an end. Among various causes ascribed to the decay of Indus Valley Civilization are the recurrent floods and other natural causes like earthquake, etc.

#### **The Indian subcontinent has been populated for around 5,000-6,000 years and its peoples joined together to form a civilization in roughly 1500 BCE when they created the Vedic Civilization, which laid out the foundations of Hinduism. Over the following millennia, the country passed through different dynasties, with modern-day India being founded in 1947, once the country won its independence from the British Empire.**
